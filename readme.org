* Introduction 
	*isoHunt* is a bash script to operate on iso files.Listing contents of iso files, copying contents of iso file into another folder.

* Motivation 
	There were number of iso files and i have to repeatedly mount,copy and umount for each iso file.That was annoying so i decided to automate this process by a command.

* Dependencies 
	isoHunt uses following programs 
	
	| mount 	 |
	| umount	 |
	| tree		 |

	To install ~tree~ command: 

	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	sudo apt-get install tree
	#+END_SRC
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	sudo pacman -S tree
	#+END_SRC

* Use isoHunt
	Using isoHunt requires root access.So,be root or act like root :P 
	Help's not that good but will be mending soon.
	
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	./main.sh help
	#+END_SRC

* TODOS 
** TODO A makefile
** TODO Work with permissions 
** TODO Some more operations
